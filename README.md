# Skaffold: From code on your laptop to cloud üíª&rarr;üì¶&rarr;‚òÅÔ∏è

[Skaffold](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold) is an open source
tool by Google that helps you build and run your source on Kubernetes locally,
or remotely on the cloud.

This repository uses [Docker's example voting app][voting] and adds Skaffold
manifest files to it and walks you through using Skaffold.
